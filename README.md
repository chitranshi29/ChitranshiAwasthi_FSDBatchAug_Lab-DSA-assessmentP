First problem :
It is an unbalanced input string because the pair of round brackets,"()",
encloses a single unbalanced closing square bracket, "]", 
and the pair of square brackets,"[]", 
encloses a single unbalanced opening round bracket, "(".


Second problem:
The idea is based on Hashing. 
We traverse binary search tree by inorder way and insert node’s value into a set. 
Also check for any node, difference between given sum and node’s value in set, if it is found then pair exists otherwise it doesn’t exist.
